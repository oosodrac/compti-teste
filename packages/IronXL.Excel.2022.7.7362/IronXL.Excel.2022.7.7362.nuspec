    <summary />
    <releaseNotes>* Adds a way to change the string value of a cell without automatically formatting the cell: this is achieved through StringValue property of a Cell.
* Adds AutoSizeRow method to Row and WorkSheet, which changes the height of a row to fit the contents
* Adds AutoSizeColumn method to Column and WorkSheet, which changes the width of a row to fit the contents
* Fixes a bug, where an exception was thrown, when a border was added or changed
* Fixes a bug, where an exception was thrown, when a cell value was changed to a formula that depends on a single cell, for example "=A1"
* Fixes a bug, where a string similar to something like "12-720" was parsed as a date in a year 720, when added to a cell. Excel doesn't support dates that predate year 1900. Strings like this are no longer parsed as dates. However, strings that could be parsed as a valid date after 1900 will still be parsed as a date. For example "12-1956". Use StringValue property to bypass this parse.
* Fixes a bug, where an existing workbook is loaded, changed and saved: cells could lose original formatting when their contents were changed. This is no longer the case.</releaseNotes>
